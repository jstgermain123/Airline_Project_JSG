# Airline_Project_JSG
Project completed for a class in post secondary degree program - involves Elastic Net Regression, Time Series Analysis, Hypothesis Testing,
and basic descriptive statistics

In 2019, the size of the US Airline Industry was $152B (“US Airline Market Share,” 2019). While this number is projected to decline by 27% in 2020 due to the 
effects of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, airline travel is still a relevant and desired form of transportation for many Americans (“US Airline Market Share,” 
2019).  For this final project we utilized a data set from the United States Department of Transportation that outlines airline carrier on-time performance from 
1987 to present. The goal in analyzing this data set was to utilize a variety of statistical analysis techniques to answer various research questions posed. This 
data set contains 34 fields each representing a different piece of information recorded about an airline flight. Due to the size of the underlying dataset, we 
utilized data solely from July 2019 for our analyses. In this month, there are 659,029 entries recorded. It should be noted that for the time series analysis 
conducted we utilized airline carrier and date information for the entirety of 2019. 

Questions posed:

Do you run a higher risk of having your flight cancelled/delayed by choosing any one particular airline over another? 
Can the variables in the data set be used to predict the carrier delay for a given flight?
Can we forecast the number of flights using past data? 
Can we create a model that predicts whether a flight was performed by a mainline carrier or a regional carrier?
